## Flowchart

Flow chart is the pictorial representation of steps which we want to represent in a 

program.

** Representation :**

1. Start /Stop -- Oval  /Pill shape -- Represents start and stop of the program.

2. Input / Output -- Parallelogram -- Represents inputs and outputs of the given program.

3. Processing -- Rectangle -- Process the given information in the program.

4. Diamond -- Rhombus --Used for Decision making.

5. Arrow -- Represents flow of the Program.

** Pseudo code:**

-**Pseudo code**, as the name suggests, is a false code or a representation of code which can be understood by even a layman with some school level programming knowledge.

- For suppose if we take sum of two numbers problem we write it in steps.

- Consider two numbers of type int as input and an operator which adds two numbers to 

produce sum of two numbers represented as output can be called as pseudo code where 

** Steps :** 

1. take inputs a and b.

2. to add and store the output use sum and operator (+). 

3.After completion of the operation store the output value to sum. 

**Advantages of using these methods :**

- Makes easy to understand.

- Even non coder can make an attempt to understand the steps involved while writing the code.
