 Lets explore Introduction to Programming and Memory Management .

## Introduction

- We need to give instructions to the computer in order to perform the task.

- In order to perform a task we need to give instructions to the computer to perform tasks.

- **Computers understand only 0's and 1's .**


- **A language used by programmers to communicate with the computer is called as a programming language.
** <br>

There are different types of Programming Languages.

Namely :

-  Procedural Language .<br>

- Functional Language.<br>

- Object oriented Language .<br>

*As we got to know regarding types lets go to the actual meanings regarding the types of programming languages.*

### 1. Procedural Language:

- Procedural Language specifies steps of well structured steps and procedures to 
compose a program.

- This type contains systematic order of **Statements ,Functions** and **Commands** to complete the task.

- **We can consider C,C++,Java as Procedural Programming.**

- ** We can also consider loops, switch and case statements in this type.**

- Ex: int a = 10;


### 2. Functional Language:

- Functional Language can be stated as writing a program in Pure Functions.

-   **Pure functions**: Pure functions are those which we can never modify variables 
      
      but create new ones as an output.

- The Functional Language is used in situations where we can perform lots of 

     different operations on the same set of data like ML.

- Ex:          

                     a = 10
                  
                    a = "Lavanya"

In this case if the object is not used it is sent to **Garbage Collection**.

**Garbage Collection**: *Objects which don't have a reference variable pointing towards 

the  object will be moved to garbage collection. *

> 
- We can consider python as Functional Language and Procedural Language.

 **First class functions: In short ->Reassigning variables. **


### 3. Object-Oriented Programming Language:

- Object Oriented Programming language revolves around **Objects.** 

- **Code + Data =Object. **


- **Related to object, class and some subsequent words we will see in further series.**


- Object oriented programming is developed to make it easier to  develop, debug, reuse 

and maintain software.

- Used to develop code in chunks (small version)to make it easier.

 As we explored Programming and its types now lets discuss related to Memory Allocation 
 
   in brief.

There are two types of Memory Allocation namely 

1. Static Allocation.

2. Dynamic Allocation.


### 1. Static Allocation:  

- Performs checking at compile time.

- Errors show at compile time.

- We need to declare datatype before using the code.

- In this type we can have more control on code.

Ex: 

                int a = 10;

 In Java , if we don't specify the datatype it shows error in the compile time itself.

i.e., At the time of compilation.

### 2. Dynamic Allocation:

- Performs checking at Run time.

- Errors cannot be identified easily.

- No need to declare datatype.

- Saves time in writing the code but might show errors at run time.

Ex:  


                      a = 10
      
        
In Python the errors are shown after compilation.(Run Time).


> 
Compile Time: Compile time refers to the time duration in which the programming code is converted to the machine code (i.e., binary code) and usually occurs before runtime.


> Run Time: Runtime is the period of time when a program is running. It begins when a program is opened (or executed) and ends with the program is quit or closed. Runtime is a technical term, used most often in software development.

Here in stack, *reference variable(a) along the address variable is pointing to the object 10  in heap memory * as illustrated in the above image.
- More than one reference variables can point to the same object.

- Change is visible to all reference variables.
