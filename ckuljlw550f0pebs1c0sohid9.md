Yes, you heard it right. Lets start exploring programming.

## Introduction

- We need to give instructions to the computer in order to perform the task.

- In order to perform a task first and foremost work is to give instructions to the computer to perform tasks.

- **Computers understand only 0's and 1's you heard it right its true.**


- **A language used by programmers to communicate with the computer is called as a programming language.
** <br>

There are different types of Programming Languages.

Namely :

-  Procedural .<br>

- Functional .<br>

- Object oriented .<br>

- Static .<br>

- Dynamic. <br>



*As we got to know regarding types lets go to the actual meanings regarding the types of programming languages.*

### 1. Procedural Programming:

- Procedural Programming specifies steps of well structured steps and procedures to 
compose a program.

- This type contains systematic order of statements,functions and commands to complete the task.

- **We can consider C,C++,Java as Procedural Programming.**

- ** We can also consider loops,switch and case statements in this type.**


### 2. Functional Programming:

- Functional programming can be stated as writing a program only in pure functions.

-   **Pure functions**: Pure functions are those which we can never modify variables 
      
      but create new ones as an output.

- The functional programming is used in situations where we can perform lots of 

     different operations on the same set of data like ML.


> 
- We can consider python as Functional  and Procedural Programming.

 **First class functions: Inshort ->Reassigning variables. **


### 3. Object-oriented programming:

- Object oriented programming revolves around **Objects.** 

- **Code + Data =Object. **


- **Related to object, class and some subsequent words we will see in further series.**


- Object oriented programming is developed to make it easier to 
  
  develop,debug,reuse and maintain software.

- Used to develop code in chunks (small version)to make it easier.

  
### 4. Static:  

- Performs checking at compile time.

- Errors show at compile time.

- We need to declare datatype before using the code.

- In this type we can have more control on code.

### 5. Dynamic:

- Performs checking at run time.

- Errors cannot be identified easily.

- No need to declare datatype.

- Saves time in writing the code but might show errors at run time.


> 
Compile Time:Compile time refers to the time duration in which the programming code is converted to the machine code (i.e binary code) and usually occurs before runtime.


> Run Time: Runtime is the period of time when a program is running. It begins when a program is opened (or executed) and ends with the program is quit or closed. Runtime is a technical term, used most often in software development.

Memory Management: 
There are two types of memory.
Namely:

1. Stack.
2. Heap.

Here in stack, *reference variable(a) along the address variable is pointing to the object 10  in heap memory * as illustrated in the above image.
- More than one reference variables can point to the same object.

- Change is visible to all reference variables.
